/**
 * This is the model for the game. It represents the entire state
 * of the game at the present moment. 
 * In this version, the player is presented with two kinds of fish
 * (good and bad) that come from sides (left or right) and have 
 * certain visual and auditory cues. The player tries to identify the
 * fish using the left or right hand pressing the appropriate key.
 * The system logs each keypress storing info about the press 
 * and the reaction time. If no fish was present it was a miscue
 * and we store the "reaction time" as the time since the last fish appeared
 * The fish can be generated either by reading data from a file or
 * they can be generated randomly with respect to some specification.
